This is a starter project to allow you to build a universal game that will run on:

**1. tvOS
2. iOS
3. OS/X**

Create a game that will run on three platforms with one code base!

### Presentation

### Music

This starter template includes four (4) background music songs created as a part of another open-source Synthesizer project I am working on that will be released shortly. You are free to use these songs in any of your apps. However, you may not resell them.

### Additional Library

This starter template includes Ray Wenderlich's excellent [SKUtils Library](https://github.com/raywenderlich/SKTUtils). These routines include several helpful custom effects, math, conversion, and other useful Sprite Kit routines.
